# backend-challenger
Project to improve my programming skills and learn new technologies

The Problem:

The ACME company is migrating their monolithic system to a microservice architecture and you’re responsible to build their MVP (minimum viable product) . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product

Your challenge is: Build an application with those features described below, if you think the requirements aren’t detailed enough please leave a comment (portuguese or english) and proceed as best as you can.

You can choose as many features you think it’s necessary for the MVP, IT’S NOT necessary build all the features, we strongly recommend to focus on quality over quantity, you’ll be evaluated by the quality of your solution.

If you think something is really necessary but you don’t have enough time to implement please at least explain how you would implement it.

Tasks
Your task is to develop one (or more, feel free) RESTful service(s) to:

Create a Store
Update a Store information
Retrieve a Store by parameters
Create an Order with items
Create a Payment for an Order
Retrieve an Order by parameters
Refund Order or any Order Item
Fork this repository and submit your code with partial commits.

Business Rules
A Store is composed by name and address
An Order is composed by address, confirmation date and status
An Order Item is composed by description, unit price and quantity.
A Payment is composed by status, credit card number and payment date
An Order just should be refunded until ten days after confirmation and the payment is concluded.
Non functional requirements
Your service(s) must be resilient, fault tolerant, responsive. You should prepare it/them to be highly scalable as possible.

The process should be closest possible to "real-time", balancing your choices in order to achieve the expected scalability.

Nice to have features (describe or implement):
Asynchronous processing
Database
Docker
AWS
Security
Swagger
Clean Code
